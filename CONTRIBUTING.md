# Contributing to python-ntfy

We welcome contributions. This guide explains how to set up your environment, follow the projectâ€™s conventions, and submit highâ€‘quality changes. You are welcome to use AI tools for assistance, but any code or documentation submitted must be thoroughly reviewed and verified by a human before opening a pull request.

## What you can work on

- Features and bug fixes in `python_ntfy`
- Documentation under `docs/`
- Tests under `tests/`
- Examples and developer experience improvements

## Prerequisites

Install these tools before contributing:

- uv: Fast Python package manager and builder â€” see `https://github.com/astral-sh/uv`
- Just: Task runner used for common workflows â€” see `https://github.com/casey/just`
- Docker and Docker Compose: Required to run integration tests locally
- Pre-commit: Optional but recommended for local quality checks â€” see `https://pre-commit.com/`

Supported Python versions: 3.12 and 3.13 (see `pyproject.toml`).

## Local setup

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch
- Run `just setup` to install hooks and sync dev deps
- Make your changes
- Run `just format` to auto-format and fix common issues
- Run `just test` to execute linters, type checks, and tests

Useful tasks (see `Justfile`):

- `just check` â€” Ruff lint and format checks
- `just mypy` â€” Type checking
- `just pytest` â€” Run tests
- `just build-docs` / `just serve-docs` â€” Build/serve docs

Tests use Docker containers defined in `tests/assets/test_containers.yml` and are orchestrated automatically by fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`.

## Coding standards

- Style and linting: Ruff (rules configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- Typing: mypy: public modules are held to stricter settings (see `tool.mypy.overrides`)
- Target Python: 3.12 (`tool.ruff.target-version`)
- Keep code readable with clear names and guard clauses; prefer explicitness
- Update or add tests for new behavior; keep coverage at or above enforced threshold

## Commit messages

- Be concise and descriptive
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add support for X")

## Pull requests

- Include a clear summary: problem, solution, and alternatives considered
- Add tests and documentation updates where applicable
- Ensure `just test` passes locally
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Link related issues, if any

## Security and licensing

- Do not commit API keys, passwords, tokens, or other secrets
- Do not copy code you are not licensed to contribute under the projectâ€™s MIT license

## AI assistance policy

- You may use AI tools to help write or refactor code and docs
- All changes must be thoroughly reviewed and verified by a human contributor before opening a PR
- The submitter is responsible for correctness and licensing

## Getting help

- Open an issue with questions or proposals
- Mention maintainers in issues/PRs as needed
