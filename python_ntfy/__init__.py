"""This module provides the NtfyClient class for interacting with the ntfy notification service.

The NtfyClient class allows users to send notifications, files, and perform various actions
through the ntfy.sh service. It also supports retrieving cached messages.

Typical usage example:

    client = NtfyClient(topic="my_topic")
    client.send("Hello, World!")
